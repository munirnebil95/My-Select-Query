# Welcome to My Select Query

•	Tech stack: Ruby

•	A CSV parser that allows the user to input CSV formatted content and then search across the entire dataset

• Constructor will receive a CSV content (as a string), first line will be the name of the column

• Implemented a where method which will take 2 arguments: column_name and value

• It returns an array of strings which matches the value

• Examples will use these CSV:
